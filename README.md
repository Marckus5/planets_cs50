# Planetary Orbit Simulator
#### Video Demo: (WIP)
#### Description:
This is a physics simulation of n-body orbital motion. 

Requires pygame-ce for source code. Install using pip
```
pip install pygame-ce
```

Controls:
* Right-click drag or Arrow Keys to pan camera
* Scroll to Zoom
* period (.) and comma (,) for timescaling

Still have a lot of issues:
* Selecting planets while zoomed in or out is buggy
* No collisions
* Coordinate system is not displayed during runtime.
